## 1. Hauptsatz
$Q = U+W$ 

Absolutely. Here's the **revised barebones thermodynamics summary**, now featuring the **specific form of the ideal gas law** and your preferred form of the **First Law**:

### 🔥 **1. What It Is**

Thermodynamics is the study of **energy**, especially how **heat (Q)** and **work (W)** affect the **internal energy (U)** of a system.

### 📜 **2. The Four Laws (Simplified)**

| Law                                            | Statement                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zeroth**                                     | If A and B are each in thermal equilibrium with C, then A is in equilibrium with B ⇒ **Defines temperature.** |
| **First**                                      | **Heat added = Increase in internal energy + Work done by the system**                                        |
| $\boxed{Q = \Delta U + W}$                     |                                                                                                               |
| **Second**                                     | The total **entropy (S)** of the universe never decreases.                                                    |
| Heat flows **spontaneously** from hot to cold. |                                                                                                               |
| **Third**                                      | Absolute zero temperature **cannot** be reached in a finite number of steps.                                  |

### ⚙️ **3. Key Concepts**

| Concept                   | Bare Definition                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **System & Surroundings** | What you're studying vs. everything else.         |
| **State Functions**       | Properties that depend only on the current state: |
| $U, S, T, P, V$           |                                                   |
| **Process Types**         |                                                   |

* Isothermal (T constant)
* Adiabatic (Q = 0)
* Isobaric (P constant)
* Isochoric (V constant) |
  \| **Work (W)** | Work done *by* a gas:
  $\boxed{W = \int P \, dV}$ |
  \| **Heat (Q)** | Energy transferred due to temperature difference. |
  \| **Entropy (S)** | A measure of disorder or energy dispersal:
  $\boxed{\Delta S = \frac{Q_\text{rev}}{T}}$ (reversible) |

### 🧮 **4. Essential Equations (Minimal Set)**

#### 🔹 First Law of Thermodynamics:

$$
\boxed{Q = \Delta U + W}
$$

#### 🔹 Specific Gas Law (preferred form):

$$
\boxed{Pv = RT}
$$

Where:

* $P$: Pressure (Pa)
* $v = \frac{V}{m}$: **Specific volume** (m³/kg)
* $R$: **Specific gas constant** (J/kg·K)
* $T$: Temperature (K)

Alternative forms for context:

* $PV = mRT$ — for total mass
* $PV = nRT$ — for moles (chemistry)

#### 🔹 Entropy (Reversible):

$$
\boxed{\Delta S = \frac{Q_\text{rev}}{T}}
$$

#### 🔹 Heat Capacity:

$$
\boxed{Q = mc\Delta T} \quad \text{or} \quad Q = nC\Delta T
$$

#### 🔹 Efficiency of Ideal (Carnot) Engine:

$$
\boxed{\eta = 1 - \frac{T_\text{cold}}{T_\text{hot}}}
$$

### 🧠 **5. Final Takeaways**

* **All heat energy** added to a system either increases **internal energy** or does **work**.
* **Entropy** quantifies the direction of processes — it never decreases in isolated systems.
* The **specific form** of the gas law is crucial when working per unit mass, especially in mechanical/thermal systems.
* Real processes are **irreversible** and less efficient than ideal models.
